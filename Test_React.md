Build a React application that does the following:

1. Fetches data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
2. Displays the post in a friendly format (doesn't have to use fancy CSS, but should be legible)
3. Has the ability to filter posts by `userId` or `id` of the post.

You are free to use any online resources you want, and if you copy any code, please cite where you sourced it from. You are free to use any libraries you want for this application, though it is not necessary. Be sure you take a look at what I suggest you look into to have hints of what I am sorta looking for!

Please put a repository to this code on Github. It would be ideal if you could build and compile this application to a `gh-pages` branch, but that is just a bonus.
