Build a small webpage **without the use of jQuery** that does the following:

1. Fetches data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
2. Displays the post in a friendly format (doesn't have to use fancy CSS, but should be legible)
3. Has the ability to filter posts by `userId` or `id` of the post.

You are free to use any online resources you want, and if you copy any code, please cite where you sourced it from.

Please put a repository to this code on Github. It would be ideal if you could also put this onto a `gh-pages` branch, but that is not necessary.
